Description:

The Personal Budget Manager is a command-line tool that allows users to manage their personal finances. Users can add income and expenses, categorize transactions, and generate monthly financial summaries.

Features:

- Add income and expenses.
- Categorize transactions.
- View all transactions or filter them by category.
- Generate monthly summaries including total income, expenses, and savings.

How it works:

Step 1: Starting the Program When the user runs the program, they are presented with the main menu. The user is prompted to choose an option by inputting a number (1, 2, 3, or 4).

Step 2: Adding a Transaction (Option 1) If the user inputs 1, they will be asked to add a transaction by entering the following details: Type (either "income" or "expense"). Amount (numerical value). Description (e.g., "Salary", "Grocery shopping"). Category (e.g., "Work", "Food", "Entertainment"). Date (in YYYY-MM-DD format).

Step 3: Viewing Transactions (Option 2) If the user inputs 2, they can view all transactions or filter them by category. The program will ask if they want to filter by a category or leave it blank to view all transactions. Example: Inputting Food will display only "Food" category transactions. If no filter is applied, all transactions are displayed.

Step 4: Viewing Monthly Summary (Option 3) If the user inputs 3, the program will ask for a month (MM) and year (YYYY) to generate a summary. It will then calculate the total income, total expenses, and the remaining savings for that month.

Step 5: Exiting the Program (Option 4) If the user inputs 4, the program will display "Exiting..." and terminate.
